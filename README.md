Our implementations for existing methods and our proposed models are flled in their respective folders. 

Existing models:
- CNN
- BERT
- Bi RNN-CNN
- BLSTM
- Bi RNN

Proposed models:
BLSTM-CNN (BERT embedding)
BLSTM-CNN (GloVe embedding)

Our Model (BLSTM-CNN (GloVe embedding) + attention) achieved an accuracy of 0.9275 on the Emotions dataset.
More details on our models and experiments can be found in Report.pdf
